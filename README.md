## What it does
“Eyenovative” is a smart mobile application that is used to help the visually impaired in their day to day life. There are 285 million people in the world living with some sort of visual impairment and 87% of these people are located in developing countries like Pakistan. 

The biggest obstacles faced by the visually impaired are in navigation and in reading text. As a solution to these problems we have made a self-contained product to be deployed on an android mobile application. Our product has been made to aid the people who have low vision or are even fully blind, in reading text and moving around obstacles. 
 
This application provides four key features to overcome the most common and tiresome obstacles faced by the visually impaired. The object detection feature helps with indoor navigation, the optical character recognition (OCR) feature helps with text reading, speech recognition feature is used in voice commands and finally the text to speech feature is used to make the application more interactive.

Apps have made life much easier for numerous people living with visual impairment or blindness. There are numerous useful apps present in today’s market for the visually impaired. However, most of these apps do not provide all four features present in our product, “Eyenovative”, with a smart and easy to use interface. Moreover, the accuracy provided by our application is unlike any free app present on the market.
